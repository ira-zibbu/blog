Here is a (mostly) exhaustive list of my writings that were publicly published from 2019 to the present. I've listed them in reverse chronological order. I have three places I personally publish frequently on - [this blog](https://ira-zibbu.github.io/post/), [my substack](https://irazibbu.substack.com/) and [my medium blog](https://ira-zibbu.medium.com/). In the past, I was associated with [Exhibit A](https://www.exhibita.in/) and [Ether Magazine](https://etherthemag.wixsite.com/etherthemag). I'm grateful to everyone who has ever read my work, provided me with feedback or made artwork for the articles.
